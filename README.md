# **BreakingBad Quote Generator**

The BreakingBad Quote Generator is a fun web application that displays random quotes along with the character who said them from the iconic TV show, *Breaking Bad*. Built with React.js and JavaScript, the app fetches quotes from a public Breaking Bad API and dynamically displays them. Hosted on Vercel, the app is fast and easy to use, offering an entertaining experience for *Breaking Bad* fans.

## Features

- **Random Quotes**: Fetches and displays random quotes from *Breaking Bad* characters using the Breaking Bad API.
- **Character Attribution**: Displays the name of the character who said each quote alongside the quote itself.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can press a "Generate" button to display a new quote and character.
- **Fast and Responsive**: Built with React.js and JavaScript for a smooth user experience.

## How it Works

1. **React.js Interface**: The app displays a random quote and the character's name who said it on the page.
2. **Button for New Quote**: When the user clicks the "Generate" button, the app makes a request to the Breaking Bad API to fetch a new random quote and its corresponding character.
